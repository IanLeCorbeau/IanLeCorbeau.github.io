<h1>Use mmdebstrap to install Debian (and more)</h1>
<hr>

<p>This is a follow up to my
<a href="https://ianlecorbeau.github.io/blog/debian-debootstrap-install.html">Debian Deboostrap Install</a>
guide posted a few years back. I will not go through the whole install
process again here, you can simply follow the guide as written and replace
the <code>debootstrap</code> command with <code>mmdebstrap</code> when you've reached that step.</p>

<h2>mmdebstrap - multi-mirror Debian chroot creation</h2>
<hr>

<p>The <code>debootstrap</code> utility is a fantastic tool that allows you to create
custom Debian installs as big or as small as you want. It's a bit limited,
though. For exmaple, it can only use a single mirror to fetch packages
when creating the system (which can be a security risk, among other things).</p>

<p>This is where <code>mmdebstrap</code> comes in. It fixes the security concern through
the use of multiple mirrors (including Debian's security mirror) and offers
much more customizing options, especially thanks to 'hooks'.</p>

<p>Make no mistake, <code>debootstrap</code> can be as powerful through a good dose of
scripting, but <code>mmdebstrap</code>'s hooks, and other built in options, offer a
much more straightforward way of doing it.</p>

<h2>The bread and butter</h2>
<hr>

<p>First, install mmdebstrap:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# apt-get install mmdebstrap -y</code></pre>
</div>

<p>If all you want is to create a minimal Debian chroot as in the debootstrap
guide linked above, substituting the <code>debootstrap</code> command with mmdebstrap,
then the following will suffice:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# /usr/bin/mmdebstrap --variant=minbase \
    --components="main non-free-firmware" \
    --include="usrmerge vim" \
    --skip=check/empty \
    $FLAVOUR $TARGET</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Replace <code>$FLAVOUR</code> with the right Debian version (currently, <code>bookworm</code>)
and <code>$TARGET</code> with the target directory, usually <code>/mnt</code> when performing
a chroot-style install.</p>

<p><code>--include="usrmerge vim"</code>: Debian now has merged usr, and this package
will be fetched regardless, but I have encountered situations where not
including it caused some issues. Vim is there because having an editor
inside the chroot is convenient, but if you prefer something else, go
for it. You can add any other packages to <code>--include</code>, but most packages
(especially things like the kernel and init system) should be installed
either in the chroot or when booted into a new install.</p>

<p><code>--skip=check/empty</code>: normally, <code>mmdebstrap</code> will fail if the target dir
is not empty. This is a problem when doing a chroot install since you will
most likely have <code>/home</code> and probably <code>/boot</code> already created and mounted.
This flag skips the check, so the command will succeed. You may remove this
flag if you are creating a chroot, rather than performing an install.</p>

<h2>Hooks</h2>
<hr>

<p>These are commands that get executed by <code>mmdebstrap</code> at various stages
of the chroot creation. They are two things, really:</p>

<ol>
<li>Individual commands passed as options to <code>mmdebstrap</code>, or</li>
<li>Scripts containing multiple commands.</li>
</ol>

<p>Types of hook:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>setup</code> hook: executes commands after directory creation and configuration
of apt and dpkg, but before packages are downloaded and installed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>extract</code> hook: executes commands after essential packages were extracted
but before they are installed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>essential</code> hook: executes commands after the essential packages were
installed, but before installing all other packages.</p></li>
<li><p><code>customize</code> hook: executes commands after the chroot was created but before
finalizing. This is the hook that gets used the most.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Hooks as individual commands</h3>
<hr>

<p>Passing a single command as a hook to <code>mmdebstrap</code> is rather simple:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# /usr/bin/mmdebstrap --variant=minbase \
    --components="main non-free-firmware" \
    --include="usrmerge vim" \
    --setup-hook='cp mydir "$1"/etc/'
    --essential-hook='echo tzdata tzdata/Areas select America | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections'
    --essential-hook='echo tzdata tzdata/Zones/America select Toronto | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections'
    --customize-hook='echo myhostname &gt; "$1"/etc/hosts' \
    --skip=check/empty \
    $FLAVOUR $TARGET</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code>--setup-hook</code> would copy a directory (mydir) to the chroot, for example
if it contained anything needed during setup.</p>

<p>The two <code>--essential-hook</code> would set the timezone to America/Toronto.</p>

<p>The <code>--customize-hook</code> would set the chroot's hostname.</p>

<p>Note that <code>"$1"</code> represents the <code>$TARGET</code>, always use "$1" whether you're
performing a command in the chroot (eg, chroot "$1" somecommand) or copying
something to the chroot (eg cp somefile "$1"/etc/skel/). This ensures that
the commands will work no matter what <code>$TARGET</code> is.</p>

<h3>Hook scripts</h3>
<hr>

<p>Passing commands to <code>mmdebstrap</code> in the above manner suffices when there
aren't many, but for extensive customization, using hook scripts become
a lot more useful.</p>

<p>First, create a hook directory:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
$ mkdir hooks</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Next, simply create your scripts, and name them after the specific stage
they should be performed in, eg <code>customize01.sh</code>. You can have multiple
scripts for each stages, and they would be executed alphabetically,
hence the <code>01</code>. A second script would be named <code>customize02.sh</code>, and so
on.</p>

<p>Hook scripts can be in any scripting language as long as its dependencies
are available in the chroot, at the stage they are to be executed.</p>

<p>Example customize01.sh script in POSIX sh:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

set -e

# Set the default debconf frontend to Readline
echo 'debconf debconf/frontend select Readline' | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections

# Enable the wheel group.
sed -i '15 s/^# //' "$1"/etc/pam.d/su
chroot "$1" addgroup --system wheel

# Set the system's hostname.
echo "myhostname" &gt; "$1"/etc/hostname

# Set the timezone
echo "tzdata tzdata/Areas select America" \
    | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections
echo "tzdata tzdata/Zones/America select New_York" \
    | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections
echo 'tzdata tzdata/Zones/Etc select UTC' \
       | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections
# This has to be done or else dpkg-reconfigure insists on using Etc
# as the default timezone for whatever stupid reason.
echo "America/New_York" &gt; "$1"/etc/timezone
chroot "$1" ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York" /etc/localtime
chroot "$1" dpkg-reconfigure -f noninteractive tzdata

# Set locale
echo "locales locales/default_environment_locale select en_US.UTF-8" \
    | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections
echo "locales locales/locales_to_be_generated multiselect en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8" \
    | chroot "$1" debconf-set-selections
chroot "$1" apt-get install locales -y</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Then <code>chmod +x</code> customize01.sh to make it executable.</p>

<p>Using the script with <code>--hook-directory</code>:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# /usr/bin/mmdebstrap --variant=minbase \
    --components="main non-free-firmware" \
    --include="usrmerge vim" \
    --hook-directory=hooks \
    --skip=check/empty \
    $FLAVOUR $TARGET</code></pre>
</div>

<p>There you go. Hooks can be used to setup the whole system the same way
you would when performing a chroot-style install.</p>

<h2>Creating tarballs</h2>
<hr>

<p>Another useful built-in fuction of <code>mmdebstrap</code> is its ability to create
an archive of the chroot automatically. This is especially useful if you
want custom chroots that can be used anywhere, or a custom Debian system
that can be installed simply by extracting the tarball to /mnt (for example).</p>

<p>To create an archive, simply change the <code>$TARGET</code> from a directory to a
tarball, eg:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# /usr/bin/mmdebstrap --variant=minbase \
    --components="main non-free-firmware" \
    --include="usrmerge vim" \
    --hook-directory=hooks \
    $FLAVOUR custom-chroot.tgz</code></pre>
</div>

<p>When extracting the chroot, you will need to use the following command
in order to make sure the proper permissions are retained:</p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
# tar xzpvf custom-chroot.tgz --xattrs --xattrs-include='*' --numeric-owner -C $TARGET</code></pre>
</div>

<p><code>$TARGET</code> can either be any directory, or /mnt in the case of an install.</p>

<h2>Bonus cleanup script</h2>
<hr>

<p>Whether you intend to share your chroot tarball, host it online or simply
use it everywhere, it is good practice to clean it up a little. </p>

<p><code>customize02.sh</code></p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

set -e

chroot "$1" apt clean
rm -rf "$1"/var/lib/apt/lists/*
rm "$1"/var/log/apt/eipp.log.xz
rm "$1"/var/log/apt/history.log
rm "$1"/var/log/apt/term.log
rm "$1"/var/log/alternatives.log
rm "$1"/var/log/dpkg.log
rm "$1"/etc/resolv.conf
rm "$1"/tmp/*
for _file in /etc/machine-id /var/lib/dbus/machine-id; do
    if [ -f "${1}/${_file}" ]; then
        rm "${1}/${_file}"
    fi
done</code></pre>
</div>
