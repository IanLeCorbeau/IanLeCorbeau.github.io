			<h1>cwmbar: Relatively Simple Status Bar for cwm</h1>

			<p>I did a post last year discussing OpenBSD's Calm Window Manager, and
			always meant to follow it up with a post about my status bar setup.
			I was too busy to finish the bar, so in the mean time I was just using
			polybar, but I always wanted to take my dwm status bar script[1] and
			adapt it to cwm.</p>

			<p>Either way, since cwm is included in my current project's live iso[2],
			I had no choice but to finish it (not that I'm complaining, any excuse
			is good to write shell scripts) so that it could be included. </p>

			<p>This is slightly less simple than statubar.sh, simply because unlike dwm,
			cwm doesn't come with any built-in bar that shows window groups and window
			title by default. Luckily there are plenty of tools that do the job.</p>

			<p><em>Note: a version specific to OpenBSD will be made, since ram usage, cpuload,
				network state and volume level all require different commands/scripting.
				Everything else in this bar version will work without a hitch, though.</em></p>

			<h2>Script and Screenshot</h2>

			<p>Script:
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanLeCorbeau/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/cwmbar">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IanLeCorbeau/dotfiles/master/.local/bin/cwmbar</a></p>

			<p><img src="../img/cwmbar-screenshot.png" alt="screenshot" class="image"></p>

			<h2>Dependencies</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Lemonbar to actually draw the status on screen.</li>
				<li>xprop(1) to display the window group we're in.</li>
				<li>wmctrl to display the window number.</li>
				<li>wmutils' core[3] to display the window name.</li>
				<li>Standard unix utilities (grep, sed, awk, etc).</li>
				<li>Spleen font[4]</li>
			</ul>

			<p>All this makes it a lot less simple than statusbar.sh (and the scripting ain't
			pretty to look at, if I can say so myself), but it does what it's supposed to.</p>

			<h2>Extra Notes</h2>

			<p>The <code>group()</code> function allows to set names for each window group if, like me, you
			want to dedicate each group for a specific task.</p>

			<p>The <code>winnum()</code> function displays the total number of windows. This is there since
			inactive and/or non-focused groups are not displayed in the bar, and it can be easy
			to forget that other groups may have opened windows. I would have preferred using the wmutils' lsw
			tool, but it's default option only lists mapped windows in the current group, and its
			option to list all windows will also list things like dunst and xcompmgr, which isn't
			desired.</p>

			<p>The wmutils tools are very useful in not only finding the window name, but also
			in setting up the width and position of the bar automatically, based on the
			properties of the root window. As a bonus, its tools can be used to extend cwm's
			functionality through scripts and keybindings. There ain't nothing better than
			that.</p>

			<p>The <code>volume_alsa()</code> function can be replaced with <code>volume-pa()</code> if using pulseaudio.
			Since I use pure alsa and I'm not familiar with pipewire, I can't create a function
			for it. In other words "patch welcomed".</p>

			<p>I chose the Spleen font because it looks great here, but naturally, it can be
			changed like everything else.</p>

			<h2>Bugs</h2>

			<p>There was a bug where the window name would disappear after opening a dialog window
			or dmenu, which was fixed by getting the id of the last window in the stack, rather
			than the focused window. This ensures that even when focus is lost, the name of the
			window that should be focused will be displayed in the bar.</p>

			<p>I have still encountered this bug once or twice afterwards, but under different
			circumstances. Which circumstances? Can't even tell as I failed to reproduce the issue.
			Regardless, it had to be pointed out.</p>

			<p>If you encounter any bug, you can contact me via email or open an issue in my dotfiles[5]
			repository on github.</p>
