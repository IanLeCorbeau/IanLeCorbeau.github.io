			<h1>Follow me on Twitter/X</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>After about 9 months of arguing with myself about how it would be smart
			to have at least one social media account, I've finally created one (a
			decision prompted by my latest protonmail <a href="https://ianlecorbeau.github.io/blog/heads-up.html">debacle</a>).</p>

			<p>I'm still not convinced it was a smart move, as I really don't care for
			social media, but it's there now, so I'll use it. I'll post updates when
			something new pops up on this site, and throw updates on other work not
			related to this site as well.</p>

			<p>Do note that this account is less than 24 hours old, so its emptiness
			is normal. I will wait until I've gained a few followers before posting
			since I don't have a habit of talking to a wall, and since this site is
			the only place where this account is promoted, it may take a while.</p>

			<p>Either way, here's the link: <a href="https://twitter.com/IanLeCorbeau">https://twitter.com/IanLeCorbeau</a>.</p>

			<p><i>I also reserve the right to delete this account without warning if I
				end up hating it.</i></p>
