			<h1>Resetting /etc/machine-id every boot</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>The /etc/machine-id and /var/lib/dbus/machine-id files can potentially
			be used to fingerprint a system over the long term. Of course, some will
			argue that this is merely FUD, but it really isn't. The key word here is
			*<em>potentially</em>*.</p>

			<p>There may not be any indications that this file is actively being used
			in a malicious capacity by anyone (or anything), but the fact that it
			can be used in such a manner should be enough for someone who cares about
			their privacy to take steps to at least minimize this potential threat.</p>

			<h2>The dead-simple solution</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>Luckily, the solution is as simple as can be: remove the file at shutdown
			so that it gets re-created by dbus at boot time. Obviously, the better
			solution would be to not have the file at all, but some programs rely on
			it, and it always gets created at boot if it doesn't exist.</p>

			<p>Removing the file at shutdown is trivial with the help of a simple init
			script. Do note that some software (systemd-journald being one of them)
			requires that this file remains the same across reboots, so if you wish
			to benefit from this script, alternatives to such programs will have to
			be used.</p>

			<h2>A small script</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>This is a simple sysvinit script that can easily be converted to runit
			or OpenRC's styles.</p>

			<p><em>Note: I will eventually create init scripts for runit and OpenRC, but
				only when I have the time to actually test them. I will not share untested
				scripts.</em></p>

<div class="shell">
<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh
### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:     rm-machineid
# Required-Start:
# Required-Stop:    
# Default-Start:
    # Default-stop:     0 6
# Short-Description:    execute the rm-machineid script
# Description:
### END INIT INFO

do_stop() {
    echo "removing machine-id"

    # on non-systemd systems, this file doesn't exist (normally)
    if [ -f /etc/machine-id ]; then
        rm -f /etc/machine-id
    fi

    rm -f /var/lib/dbus/machine-id
}

case "$1" in
    start)  echo "invalid option" ;;
    stop)   do_stop ;;
    *)  do_stop ;;
esac
</pre></code>
</div>

			<p>You can also download the script here:
			<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RagnarokOS/src/master/base/etc/init.d/rm-machineid">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RagnarokOS/src/master/base/etc/init.d/rm-machineid</a></p>
	
			<p>This script should be added to the shutdown and reboot runlevels (usually
			0 and 6). </p>
	
			<h2>Final note</h2>
			<hr>
	
			<p>Distributions like Devuan, tails and whonix already take care of regenerating
			machine-id every boot, so this script is not necessary if you're using one of
			them. There may be other distributions doing the same thing, so refer to their
			own docs to see if they do. I can only confirm that Debian does not, and it's
			highly likely that any distribution that uses systemd (and systemd-journald)
			do not either.</p>
