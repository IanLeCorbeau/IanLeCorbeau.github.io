			<h1>Leave Politics Out of FOSS?</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>It wasn't too long ago that I actually agreed with the "leave politics
			out of FOSS" statement. I'm a very political person, but for the longest
			time I thought "what does my political views have to do with software
			anyway?". This logic is flawed, though. My core values might not be the
			only reason why I'm into FOSS, but they still play a major role in it.
			Why else would I be spending time making guides and writing about this
			stuff?</p>

			<p>I actually want to <strong>own</strong> the computers that I buy (something you don't
			get with proprietary software and operating systems nowadays, if ever).
			I want the freedom to do whatever the hell I want with my hardware and
			the software that it runs. I want the projects I work on, support, or use,
			to be developed based on sane principles like technical merit, simplicity,
			and code correctness. I care about that as much as I care about things like,
			you know, not being spied on. And I enjoy encouraging strangers on the
			internet to care about these things as well.</p>

			<p>This, right there is political in itself. There is a fringe, but <strong>very</strong>
			vocal group of people in FOSS that will gladly tell you that "FOSS is
			inherently political", and it turns out that they're right, for once.</p>

			<p>I understand why, in protest against the CoC-wielding mob, someone will
			yell "leave politics out of FOSS!", but the problem is that if you leave
			your politics out, you're leaving all the room to those who want to destroy
			the movement from within, and look where we're at now.</p>

			<p>Let's be honest, when we say "leave politics out of FOSS", we really mean
			leave <em>those</em> politics out of FOSS, because they go against everything that
			it stands for. Those who want to eradicate meritocracy, and deny
			others their freedom to speak or think, should not be willingly given that
			much power.</p>

			<p>Yes, this movement was built on political principles, but they are being
			replaced with something that will inevitably lead to its fall. The question
			remains how many people are willing to swim against the current.</p>
