			<h1>OpenBSD’s CWM: An Underrated Window Manager (Plus a Comfy Config)</h1>

			<hr>

			<p>The first time I tried OpenBSD’s Calm Window Manager, I thought it was really good,
			but at that point I was merely curious as to what it looked like and didn’t explore
			all its functionalities. I’ve always been more than satisfied with dwm, and its tiling
			capabilities are essential to my workflow, so giving cwm a serious look wasn’t a top
			priority. However, in time, I started developing two separate workflows: one on my
			desktop, and another on my laptop. The two aren’t that different, but are each
			influenced by the type of work I do and screen real-estate.</p>

			<p>My laptop’s screen is relatively small, even on its dedicated external monitor (just
			a small, 720p TV I had lying around), and automatic tiling is something I began getting
			away from on that particular device. On there, I prefer having windows maximized and only
			splitting them as needed, as you do in Vim and Tmux. Mentioning tmux is also quite
			relevant. In recent months, it has become an integral part of my workflow and I no longer
			need to have multiple terminals opened on the same tag/group/workspace, just a single
			terminal using tmux windows and panes. This does not render automatic tiling useless on
			my desktop, but it does on my laptop.</p>

			<p>Mind you, this is easily achievable on dwm, but I wanted to give cwm a serious look since
			it’s part of OpenBSD’s base after all (same reason why I tried tmux instead of GNU screen
			or dvtm + abduco). My philosophy on OpenBSD is that if a program from the base system does
			what I want, then there’s no need to install something else.</p>

			<p>With all that said, what’s so good about cwm? Let’s see.</p>

			<h2>Quick Notes</h2>

			<hr>

			<p>A few notes and particularities regarding cwm before we go to the comfy config part.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Made by OpenBSD devs, for OpenBSD: this is pretty much “proof of quality”, be it in
					terms of usage, simplicity and code quality. No further justifications needed here.  </li>
				<li>Minimal: no superfluous features. It contains more than stock dwm, but still nothing
					insane.  </li>
				<li>Sane config file: cwm’s config file uses a simple <code>&lt;option&gt;</code>&nbsp;<code>&lt;value&gt;</code> format.
					Can’t get any more straight forward than that.  </li>
				<li>Keyboard-driven workflow: this is what cwm is geared towards. Whatever you want to do
					with a window (move, resize, snap, maximize, hide, etc), there’s a keybinding for it.
					Granted, you can still bind mouse buttons to do things, but I’ve personally omitted that
					(originally I just forgot to add it, but I don’t actually need to move/resize windows
					with the mouse, so I’ve left it out completely).  </li>
				<li>Groups: a more flexible alternative to workspaces. It’s exactly as it sounds. You can
					group certain windows together and view multiple groups at once if need be. You can still
					achieve a workflow that’s essentially the same as you would with workspaces by adding
					<code>sticky yes</code> to .cwmrc. You can also easily set certain programs to open in specific
					groups by default using the autogroup option. Bonus: you can have both a classic
					workspace-like workflow AND do it the cwm way.  </li>
				<li>Menus: there are search and exec menus for windows, groups and programs. This includes
					a custom menu where you can add specific programs to launch.  </li>
				<li>Manual tiling: kinda. You can tile 2 windows either horizontally or vertically using
					<code>htile</code> and <code>vtile</code>.  </li>
				<li>Gaps: who doesn’t love gaps? Even if you don’t, you’ll need to at least set a gap at
					the top or bottom of the screen so that windows don’t cover your status bar.  </li>
				<li>Ignore: cwm can completely ignore specific programs/windows if you tell it to.
					Useful for statusbars that don’t have an <code>override_redirect</code> option.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Configuration</h2>

			<hr>

			<p>Cwm’s configuration file is ~/.cwmrc, which is not provided by default. It'll be up to you
			to create your own config. The cwmrc(5)[1] man page contains everything there is to know,
			and it can also be useful to start with a pre-existing config and go from there.</p>

			<p>My own config file[2], with extra comments:</p>

			<div class="shell">

			<p>There are other config options I have yet to touch, which I will leave to you to explore.</p>

			<h2>Linux Availability</h2>

			<hr>

			<p>A portable version of cwm[3] which can be installed on Linux (as well as the BSDs) exists.
			Debian (and derivatives), Gentoo, Void Linux, Alpine Linux, NixOS, Fedora all have it
			in their official repositories.</p>

			<p>On Arch Linux, it’s only available in the AUR[4], though I’d personally just fetch its
			source and compile it myself.</p>
