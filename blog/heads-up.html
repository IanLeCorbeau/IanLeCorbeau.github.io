			<h1>Heads-up to Those Who Sent Me an Email Since September</h1>

			<p>
			This is a quick heads up to anyone who have attempted to contact me via
			email since around September 15. It seems like protonmail (or at least,
			my account) had a brain fart and I did not receive any reply or mail since
			that date (and it's possible my replies did not go through either). 
			</p>

			<p>
			Today I had confirmation that this was indeed a proton issue, and it seems
			to be at least partly resolved. So if you did send an email and never got
			a reply, you can resend it again.
			</p>

			<p>
			Since I can't confirm that the issue is 100% resolved: if you still don't
			receive a reply within at least 48 hours, you can feel free to send a mail
			to my backup account (ian.lecorbeau (at) gmail (dot) com). This is a backup
			account only, so please go though protonmail first. And note that because
			this is gmail, there is 0 privacy (so think twice before sending your plans
			for world domination).
			</p>
