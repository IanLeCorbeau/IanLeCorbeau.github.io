			<h1>A Hardened, Clang-built Linux Kernel for Debian</h1>
			<hr>

			<p>For the most part, "Debian user" and "likes living on the edge" don't
			go hand in hand, but if you're one of those who enjoy stable systems,
			yet still like to experiment and test new things, Ragnarok's build
			of the Linux kernel is available for testing.</p>

			<p>This version of the Kernel is built with the full LLVM/Clang toolchain
			using Debian's linux-source package (so it's the same version used in
			Debian stable). It's also compiled with ThinLTO[1] and enables clang's
			Control Flow Integrity[2], which is "designed to abort the program upon
			detecting certain forms of undefined behavior that can potentially allow
			attackers to subvert the programâ€™s control flow".</p>

			<p>If this is the sort of thing that gets your juices flowing, you can get
			the kernel and its associated headers and libc-dev packages here:</p>

			<p><a href="https://github.com/RagnarokOS/kernel-build/releases">https://github.com/RagnarokOS/kernel-build/releases</a></p>

			<h2>But first, a word of caution</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>It goes without saying that this should not be used on mission critical
			systems just yet, and with this being a hardened kernel which enables
			"panic on oops", if anything goes wrong, the kernel <em>will</em> panic. So if
			you're going to test this on a system where any type of meaningful work
			is being done, it's important to follow the rule of "save your work often".</p>

			<p>That said, don't interpret the above warning as meaning "this kernel is
			unstable and can shit the bed at any moment". Aside from the differences
			mentioned above, this is still the same as Debian's kernel. Under normal
			circumstances, the kernel should not panic and if it does, there's going
			to be a good reason for it (and you probably <em>do</em> want it to panic in
			such a case).</p>

			<p>Speaking of kernel panics, I did encounter one at boot time on a very
			old laptop. I initially blamed it on a faulty module, but I'm not so sure
			anymore. With kernel 6.1.64, the issue was gone, then back with version
			6.1.66, then gone again with version 6.1.67. I have a hunch that perhaps
			this occurred due to not installing the headers and libc-dev packages,
			but don't quote me on that as I could very well be full of crap here.</p>

			<p>Either way, let's move on.</p>

			<h2>The .config file</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>As previously mentioned, this kernel is built with Debian's linux-source[3]
			package. Their kernel config was also used as a starting point in order
			to ensure that it worked on as many setups as Debian's version.</p>

			<p>You can inspect Ragnarok's .config file which is located in the kernel-build
			reposotiry here:
			<a href="https://github.com/RagnarokOS/kernel-build/blob/master/ragnarok.conf">https://github.com/RagnarokOS/kernel-build/blob/master/ragnarok.conf</a></p>

			<p>You can also inspect the config.diff file from the same repository, which
			highlights the differences between the two kernels. Furthermore, once booted
			with the kernel you can run the <code>diff -u</code> command against <code>ragnarok.conf</code> and
			/boot/config-*-ragnarok-amd64 files to ensure they match (and if they don't, something is
			wrong and you should most definitely open an issue on github, pasting the
			output of your <code>diff</code> command.</p>

			<h2>Building this kernel yourself</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>If you're understandably not comfortable installing and using a kernel built
			by some random guy on the internet, you can easily build it yourself on any
			Debian system.</p>

			<p>As a prerequisite, you will need a properly set up LLVM/Clang 16 or higher,
			which means that on Bookworm, you will have to add the apt.llvm.org repo.
			The set up process is highlighted in my previous post (simply skip the
			"Using LLVM/Clang as the default toolchain (Optional)" step):</p>

			<p><a href="https://ianlecorbeau.github.io/blog/latest-llvm-clang-debian.html">https://ianlecorbeau.github.io/blog/latest-llvm-clang-debian.html</a></p>

			<p>That being said, save yourself some trouble and do this in a chroot. I will
			happily help with any building issues, provided the below steps were followed.</p>

			<p><em>As always, '#' means the command needs to be run as root, '$' means the command
				should be run as an unprivileged user.</em></p>

			<p>First, debootstrap a 'buildd' variant of Debian Bookworm:</p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
# apt-get install debootstrap
$ mkdir -p build/kernel
# deboostrap --variant=buildd bookworm build/kernel http://deb.debian.org/debian/</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>Next, avoid running <code>git clone</code> as the root user (even if it would be in
			a chroot) by cloning then moving the repo:</p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
$ cd build/
$ git clone https://github.com/RagnarokOS/kernel-build.git
# mv kernel-build kernel/usr/src/</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>While still in the build directory, change root to the kernel directory:</p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
# chroot kernel/</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>Add the LLVM repo as highlighted in the linked post above, then run the llvmsetup.sh
			script located in the kernel-build repo:</p>

			<p><i>Note: if you chose to install LLVM 17 or 18, open the script and replace
				VERSION=16 with the version of your choice</i></p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
/usr/src/kernel-build/llvmsetup.sh</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>Install the linux-source package and its build dependencies, extract the
			tarball, copy the Ragnarok config file and cd into the linux-source-*
			directory:</p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
# apt-get install linux-source
# apt-get build-dep linux
# cd /usr/src
# tar xvf linux-source-*.tar.xz
# cp kernel-build/ragnarok.conf linux-source-*/.config
# cd linux-source-*</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>Run make oldconfig to make sure the config is up to date. 90% of the
			time nothing new will be added, but sometimes it does happen. </p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
# make CC=clang LLVM=1 oldconfig</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>Now, just start compiling/building the package and be aware that this
			builds a distribution kernel, so it will take some time.</p>

			<div class="shell">
				<pre><code>
# make CC=clang LLVM=1 -j$(nproc) bindeb-pkg</pre></code>
			</div>

			<p>When done, the linux-image, linux-headers and linux-libc-dev can be moved
			out of the chroot and installed with either <code>dpkg -i</code> or <code>apt-get install</code>
			like any other packages.</p>

			<h2>Caveats</h2>
			<hr>

			<p>Whether you're using the pre-built deb or building the package yourself,
			this kernel does not support secure boot.</p>

			<p>On top of that, only modules that were signed at build time will be allowed
			to load, so out-of-tree modules (such as proprietary NVIDIA drivers) won't
			work unless you build the kernel yourself and sign the modules with the
			<code>signing_key.pem</code> file located in linux-source-*/certs/.</p>

			<p>If you're unsure whether you need out-of-tree modules or not, chances are
			that you don't. So there's that.</p>
