<h1>Kettlebells: Hardstyle vs Sport Style</h1>

<p>I will preface this by saying that this post is not about pitting the two
common Kettlebell training "styles" against one another (that's not what
the "vs" is for). I will not contribute to some religious war between the
two because, to put it bluntly, it's dumb as hell. Both styles work. Period.</p>

<p>This isn't me trying to be the training equivalent of "politically correct".
Both work, because they actually do. This isn't some ground breaking revelation
either. I'm certainly not the first nor the last to say it.</p>

<p>The general recommendation when someone asks which "style" they should use
is "if you want strength and power, do hardstyle, if you want endurance,
do sport style". This is correct, of course. Who am I to disagree with
people who have been training with Kettlebells for far longer than I have?</p>

<p>I will, however, disagree with the take-away point that some (most?) people
will get from that statement.</p>

<h2>The Nuance</h2>

<p>I don't really like to make assumptions when it comes to how other people
think. In this case, however, I don't think I'm wrong to assume that a
significant amount of people will interpret "hardstyle for strength, sport
style for endurance" to mean both the <em>programming</em> <strong>and</strong> the <em>technique</em>.</p>

<p>The assumption is that since sport style technique (which many sport style
guys, especially of the old school variety, will simply call <strong>good</strong>
technique) is meant to be efficient, it won't be as good for strength
and power development. This is, of course, completely wrong.</p>

<p>Being as efficient as possible doesn't mean it won't build strength and power.
It does take more brute strength and force to Clean, or Snatch, an equal amount
of weight with the hardstyle technique, granted, but what the hell are you
going to do when you reach a plateau doing it that way?</p>

<h2>The Hardstyle Problem</h2>

<p>Hardstyle Kettlebell training is what I'm used to the most. I never really
considered myself a "hardstyle guy", per se, but it's the technique I've
primarily used for the swing/clean/snatch, and my programming style is very
similar to theirs (though I do a lot more volume/movements than most popular
programs out there advocate for).</p>

<p>I also believe, rather religiously, in their "Big Six" movements: the Swing,
Clean, Press, Snatch, Squat and Turkish Get Up (I believe in them so much
that, indeed, I capitalize their name). I also firmly believe that your
training week is not complete until you have performed all of these moves
at least once. And yes, I'm ready to die on that hill.</p>

<p>There is but one issue with hardstyle training, or to be more accurate,
its swing technique. If we're thinking about the swing as a foundation
for the Clean and the Snatch, then the hardstyle technique isn't really
conductive to lifting the most amount of weight you possibly can.</p>

<p>I get it, one of the principles of hardstyle is to get you as strong as
possible with less weight. After all, they'll never go as heavy as a
barbell can. But does that mean you should limit yourself to double
24kg, or double 32s?</p>

<p>True, being able to Clean &amp; Press two 32KG Kettlebells is no small feat,
but with hard work, you'll eventually get there. Should you stay there
forever? Absolutely not (and that's also the point where switching to
competition bells become <strong>really</strong> useful).</p>

<p>I used double 32s as an example here, but the following principle applies
regardless of the weight: by learning, and using the sport style "pendulum"
swing, you will make better progress over time, allowing you to become
stronger and more powerful.</p>

<h2>The "How"</h2>

<p>First, I do not advise ditching the hardstyle Swing. These are fucking
great. And no, there's no way to put it without swearing. No matter what
you do, no matter how/why you train, whether you're a kettlebell guy, a
barbell guy, a freakin' ballerina, the Swing is always going to be a great
tool. Do 'em!</p>

<p>As to how you can utilize both, well, there's lots of ways. One way would
be to stick to sport style when you move the heaviest weight, while using
the hardstyle variation (perhaps just the Swing) as accessory/supplemental
work.</p>

<p>Another would be to first use sport style when moving up in bell weight,
and when you can do sets of 5, switch to hardstyle. And yet another way,
if you like doing high rep sets, is to start with hardstyle and when the
set gets harder, finish it with sport style. </p>

<p>These are just three examples. Be creative.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that this whole thing is when you train for general
fitness/strength purposes. If you're interested in actually competing in
Kettlebell sport, do not listen to my advice. Get a coach instead.</p>

<h2>Some Notes</h2>

<p>If you've never done kettlebell training before and wonder which version
to learn first, I don't really have a specific answer. Opinions vary on
that, and I don't think any of them are wrong. No matter which version you
learn first, if you do it long enough the movement will become instinctive,
and learning the other will mean fighting against your instincts.</p>

<p>Perhaps the answer is to learn both at the same time, and treat them as
completely different movements (which they are, kinda). Learn the HS two
hand swing, while practicing the sport style movement pattern without
weight. When you're ready to add weight to it, do it light, one handed,
and for reps.</p>

<p>It should also be pointed out that using the sport style pendulum swing
does not mean you have to learn or use their rack position. I don't. My
rack position is more of a hybrid, similar to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fx2Ic1Tb3Rs">Joe Daniels'</a>, simply because,
much like him, I do not have the build (ie, upper arm length) to put my
elbows in the iliac crest.</p>

<p>The KB sport rack position is, much like their swing, the more efficient
way of putting the most amount of weight, for the most amount of reps,
overhead, granted, but you have to make due with what you've got.</p>
