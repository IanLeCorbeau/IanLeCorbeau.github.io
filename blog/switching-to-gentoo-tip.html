<h1>Tip: Switching to Gentoo? Start in a Virtual Machine</h1>

<p>Considering the type of Linux user that I am, Gentoo has always seemed
like the perfect match. However, it took me a few years to finally make
the switch. There's a few reasons for that, but the main one is pretty
simple: I can not afford having my daily driver inoperable for more than
a few hours at a time.</p>

<p>After switching to Gentoo, I can safely say that using and maintaining it
is no more time consuming than any other distribution, but installing it
is another story. How long it takes to install depends on how you configure
your system, and since I tweaked a lot of stuff (which includes using LLVM
as the default toolchain, and gcc as a fallback) it goes without saying
that in my case, an install would take at least a day.</p>

<p>So how did I manage to finally switch to Gentoo? Easy: I started in a VM.</p>

<h2>The Logic</h2>

<p>As I mentioned above, I can't have my daily driver stay in an inoperable state
for a whole day, nor do I have the time to spend a whole day installing a
system. If you're not in that situation, or if you plan on installing on a
secondary device, then it may not be worth your while to do this in a VM first.
Likewise, you could stick to defaults and use Gentoo's pre-built binaries if you
don't need to have any special configuration and <code>USE</code> flags.</p>

<p>In any case, the point is simple: configuring the whole system (+ kernel) and
building packages in a Virtual Machine allowed me to do it in my free time and
it didn't matter how long it would take.</p>

<p>So, how did I go about it?</p>

<h2>The Process</h2>

<p>This is nothing special. Install the system following the
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64">handbook</a>, just like you would on
bare metal. Configure portage to your liking, and make sure the <code>buildpkg</code> feature
is enabled (it should be enabled by default). With <code>FEATURE=buildpkg</code>, every
software you install with <code>emerge</code> will be saved to <code>/var/cache/binpkgs</code> (or
wherever you tell portage to save your packages) in the <code>.gpkg.tar</code> format.</p>

<p>Building packages is the real time saver here, but note that you won't be able
to use the <code>-march=native</code> compile flag. When you're done installing, configuring
and building packages, save all your config files (don't forget the @world file as
well), and create a tarball of <code>/var/cache/binpkgs</code>, e.g.</p>

<pre><code># cd /var/cache/binpkgs
# tar czvf ../binpkgs.tgz .
</code></pre>

<p>This will save the tarball to <code>/var/cache</code>.</p>

<p>When you're ready to install on bare metal, proceed with the installation. When
you reach the
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Stage#Configuring_compile_options">Configuring compile options</a>
step, copy your configs to the appropriate directories. Next, when you reach the
<a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Handbook:AMD64/Installation/Base#Optional:_Updating_the_.40world_set">Optional: Updating the @world set</a>
phase, extract <code>binpkgs.tgz</code>:</p>

<pre><code># mkdir -p /var/cache/binpkgs
# tar xzvf /path/to/binpkgs.tgz -C /var/cache/binpkgs
</code></pre>

<p>Then, just to be 100% sure, run</p>

<pre><code># emaint -f binhost
</code></pre>

<p>This command ensures that the <code>Packages</code> file is updated to contain all packages
in <code>binpkgs</code>. If you installed <code>app-portage/mirrorselect</code> first, for example,
then this step is mandatory. Remember this command, because if you ever decide
to build packages on another system (be it a VM or other computer) and copy them
to your main system, you will need to run it before updating.</p>

<p>Afterwards, emerge @world with the proper flags</p>

<pre><code># emerge -avuDN --with-bdeps=y --usepkg @world
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on how many packages you have in <code>world</code>, it may take a while, but
nowhere near as long as if you had to compile everything. Take note that
<code>--usepkg</code> will prefer ebuilds over binpkgs if a newer version of a package is
available, which means some packages may be compiled instead. You could use the
<code>--usepkgonly</code> flag instead, but I strongly discourage it, because you'll still
have to update those packages afterwards anyway.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid rebuilding packages as much as possible, make sure to emerge
@world in your VM before creating <code>binpkgs.tgz</code> and rest assured that the update
frequency on Gentoo sits somewhere in between Debian and Arch, which means that
unless you have a ton of packages, you probably won't have to rebuild too many
packages even if you waited a day or two before doing your final install.</p>

<h2>About the Kernel</h2>

<p>The <code>binpkgs</code> feature will not build a package for the kernel, however. If you
choose to configure your own kernel, you can create a "release" tarball by using
the <code>dir-pkg</code> Make option:</p>

<pre><code># make -j$(nproc) dir-pkg
[...wait for compilation to finish]
# cd tar-install
# tar czvf ../linux-${VERSION}.tgz --sort=name *
</code></pre>

<p>To install the kernel to your main system, extract the tarball and copy the
contents of <code>boot</code> to your boot directory, and the directory in <code>lib/modules</code>
(e.g. 6.12.21-gentoo) to <code>/usr/lib/modules</code>.</p>

<p>You can find more details here (though using <code>kmake</code> is not necessary): <br>

<h2>Closing thoughts</h2>

<p>This may not be the traditional method to install Gentoo, but it does save you a
lot of time during installation. One added benefit is that you can experiment as
much as you please, and risk breaking the system, without issues. Of course, I
advise to clone your VM once you have a basic/working install in order to avoid
having to reinstall if you go too far.</p>

<p><em>Note: cloning VMs shouldn't be used as an excuse to avoid fixing issues that
might occur during experimentation. Fixing a system rather than reinstalling is
a skill that can save your behind in the future.</em></p>

<p>If you're interested in seeing how far Gentoo can be configured, have a look at
