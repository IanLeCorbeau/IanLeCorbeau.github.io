<h1>Off Day Training</h1>

<p>I'm aware that "off day training" is a bit of an oxymoron, but when it
comes to training, I rarely take any real off days. In theory, Sunday
if my off day, but sometimes I'll reschedule my Saturday training to
that day instead. By the way, this is the only time 'skipping' a
workout doesn't bother me, since I know I'll do it the next day.</p>

<p>Now, just because I only have one true off day doesn't mean I lift
every day of the week. For most of the year I train with a full body
split on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Then, on three of the four "off"
days, I do an extra workout. This extra workout is the same every time,
and can be done by anyone, whether they're also lifting weights or not.
In fact, doing just this is still a thousand times better than not being
physically active at all.</p>

<p>Here it goes.</p>

<h2>The Workout</h2>

<ol>
<li>10 minutes of Turkish Get Ups</li>
<li>30 minutes walking</li>
<li>20 minutes static stretching</li>
</ol>

<p>It's that simple.</p>

<h2>The Rundown</h2>

<p><strong>10 minutes of Turkish Get Ups</strong>: In theory, it's 10 total TGUs, 5 each
sides, which shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. How I approach them
varies depending on the day, and whether a heavier weight than I'm used
to is being used/tested.</p>

<p>I might do 5 TGUs on the left, rest a minute, then 5 on the right. Or I
might do them EMOM (Every Minute on the Minute), alternating between sides
each minute. That means minute 1: left, minute 2: right, minute 3: left,
minute 4: right, and so on...</p>

<p>Yes, 10 Minutes/10 TGUs total, 3 times a week, is enough.</p>

<p><strong>30 minutes of walking</strong>: No real explanation needed. Just walk. Now,
these days I mostly walk with a weight vest, but this is not mandatory. Rucking (walking
with a heavy backpack) is also a good choice.</p>

<p><strong>20 minutes of static stretching</strong>: for the better part of a decade, the
idea of static stretching made me nauseous. I thought it was only for pussies.
Guess what? I was dead wrong. I got so tight that just walking made my hip
flexors feel like they were going to rip apart. Now I stretch, and I learned
to enjoy it.</p>

<p>Stretching is something that has to be personalized. It depends heavily on
which parts are tight and how tight they are. Find the right stretches for
you and have at it. </p>

<p>With that being said, if you're a regular reader of this blog, chances are
you might be working sitting on your behind all day, so stretching your
shoulders, back, abs, hip flexors and hamstrings would do you good.</p>

<p>Tip: during this "off" day training, I hold each stretch 30 seconds, for 2
sets. On training days I do the same stretching routine post-workout, but
only for 1 set.</p>

<p>That's it. Now go for it!</p>

<h2>Extra Notes on Turkish Get Ups</h2>

<p>Can you swap TGUs for something else? No. If you don't want to do them,
just walk and stretch. Note that you'll be missing out, however. Being
able to get off the floor under load is a skill that should be mastered
by everyone, and maintaining it will be especially useful (or, you know,
potentially life-saving) as you age.</p>

<p>If you've never done TGUs before, watch videos and learn. Start without
weight, then balance a book or a shoe on your fist, then add weight if
you can. I'll be honest, doing them weighted is better, but doing them
without weight is still better than not doing them at all.</p>

<p>The TGU is a movement that seems incredibly complicated at first, but
once you've mastered it, you realize how simple it is. They can be very
frustrating to learn, which makes learning them extremely satisfactory.
And trust me, if someone as impatient as I am can learn them, anyone can.</p>
